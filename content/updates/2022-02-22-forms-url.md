This small update fixes a bug in which the embeddable HTML form didn’t include
the full URL in the form’s `action` attribute.
<!--more-->
The full `action` attribute is now included in embeddable forms, no longer
requiring them to be manually adjusted.

This update also nicely formats (pretty-printing) the embeddable HTML, making
it easier to read and customize.

A related feature request is now being tracked on Keila’s GitHub:
[Add option to generate embedded form markup without styles](https://github.com/pentacent/keila/issues/114).
