Most email newsletter tools are fully owned and controlled by a single company.
Keila is different: Keila is an Open Source newsletter tool built with the help
of a community of volunteers and freely available to everyone.

## What does it mean that Keila is an Open Source newsletter tool?

Open Source software (also called free/libre software) is all about granting
certain freedoms to users that ordinary _proprietary_ software doesn’t afford.

- You want to understand the inner workings of a program and read its source
  code? No problem!
- You want to change the program’s code to make it better suit your use-case?
  Go right ahead!
- You want to share the program with friends, colleagues, or the general public?
  With Open Source software, you can.

## Is Open Source More Secure?

Some people worry that with the source code of Open Source programs being
available, it might be easier to find and create exploits in the software. The
opposite is true, however! Finding exploits in Open Source software isn't really
easier than in proprietary closed source software - the source code isn't even
required for finding them. But on the other hand, many more people can look over
the code of an Open Source program, report potential vulnerabilities, and fix
them.

Another security advantage of Open Source software is that you can audit a
program and then run it yourself - you don’t have to trust any third party.

## Which Open Source License Does Keila Use?

Keila uses the [GNU Affero General Public License (GNU AGPL), Version 3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html.en).
Here are some of your rights and obligations under the AGPLv3:

### Rights

- You can access the Keila source code and run your own instance of it for any
  purpose you see fit
- You can make modifications to Keila and share share your modifications with
  other people

### Obligations

- If you run your own instance of Keila, you must make the source code of Keila
  (including all modifications) available to all users who interact with it.
  This includes not just users with an account on your instance of Keila but also
  contacts who interact with other parts of your Keila instance, such as the
  signup form, the unsubscribe page, or the email tracking feature.

For more information about the AGPLv3, check out the
[FAQ](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html) from the Free Software
Foundation and the [full license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html.en).

## Open Core? No Thanks!

Some programs are only partially released as Open Source software with some
components remaining proprietary or paid add-ons. This is commonly called
[Open Core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model).

While Open Core can
be a valid business model for some, we are committed to keeping Keila 100% Open
Source with no proprietary components. We believe in free software and
its many advantages for our users and our community.

## Can Keila be self-hosted?

Yes! Keila is a great choice when you’re looking for a self-hosted newsletter
tool. You can easily install Keila from our
[official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/pentacent/keila).

## Is Mailchimp also Open Source?

Most other email marketing tools such as Mailchimp, Brevo (Sendinblue), or
Convertkit are not Open Source.

For most newsletters, Keila is a great Open Source Mailchimp alternative today!
