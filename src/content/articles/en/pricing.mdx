## FAQs

### Why is there no free plan?

There are two reasons why companies offer free plans: Either they’re paying for
them out of their marketing budget, or it’s a hint that _you_ are the real
product and they’re making a profit from using your data.

Keila is a small bootstrapped business without a big marketing budget and we
will never sell you data. That’s why there is no free plan.

### Can I get a discount?

If you’re an Open Souce project, or if you’re having trouble affording a paid
Keila plan for your non-profit or for your small business, we might be able to
find a solution together.

For any questions regarding discounts, please reach out at <Email user="hello" domain="keila.io" />.

### Can I get paid support for self-hosting?

Of course! If you would like us to help you set up your own Keila instance,
don’t hesitate to contact us at <Email user="hello" domain="keila.io" />!
