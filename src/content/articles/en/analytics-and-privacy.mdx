title: Track Your Newsletter Campaigns for Great Email Analytics (Or Don’t, It’s Your Choice!)
description: Analytics

With Keila you have the choice: Track email opens and clicks for your campaigns
or send your emails without any tracking at all.

## How Do Newsletter Analytics Work?

To track your newsletter campaign, Keila, Keila does two things:

1. Add a tracking pixel to your email.
   The tracking pixel is an invisible tiny image that includes a personalized
   tracking code. When the tracking pixel is loaded from the Keila server, we
   know the email has been opened.
2. Make all your links tracking-enabled
   When you add a link to your email newsletter, Keila replaces it with a link
   to the Keila server that includes a personalized tracking code and
   immediately redirects to your original link when opened. Like this, we know
   which links have been clicked by your newsletter recipients.

Each time, a tracking pixel or link is activated, Keila stores this information
and that’s how you get newsletter analytics.

## Bounce and Complaint Handling

When you send your email campaigns, it’s important to be aware of bounces (i. e.
when an email can't be delivered) and spam complaints (i. e. when a user
reports your email as spam to their ISP).

If you’re using _Send with Keila_ on Keila Cloud, we take care of
automatically handling bounces and spam complaints. Contacts are unsubscribed
automatically after a hard bounce (e.g. when the server reports that an email
address doesn't exist) or after three recent soft bounces (e.g. when the server
reports an inbox is out of storage space).
When we receive a complaint, we also unsubscribe that contact from your project.

If you’re self-hosting Keila, you can enable automatic bounce and complaint
handling for SES senders.

## How Does Keila Respect User Privacy?

Keila tries to avoid tracking information about contacts that is not strictly
necessary while still providing useful campaign analytics insights.

Keila doesn’t track IP address or cookies from tracking pixels and clicks and on
Keila Cloud, we don’t cross-reference contacts between projects.

We’re also planning to add more advanced privacy options for contacts such as
disabling tracking entirely or storing only aggregate analytics for campaigns.

## Don’t Want Tracking?

Tracking users has become the de-facto standard for all email newsletter tools
and across the wider internet. If you don’t want to be part of that, Keila makes
it easy for you: Just disable the _Enable click/open tracking_ checkbox and
your subscribers can enjoy privacy-friendly and tracking-free newsletters.

Only the number of emails sent, bounces, and spam complaints are reported on the
campaign analytics page when tracking is disabled.
