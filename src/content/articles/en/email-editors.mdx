## Multi-Column Layouts with the Block Editor

The most flexible editor choice in Keila is the _Block Editor_. With the block
editor, you can create multi-column layouts, and place components using an
easy-to-use WYSIWYG interface.

The block editor comes with all the blocks you need to build a great-looking
email:

- Text paragraphs
- Headings
- Images (with support for links, captions, alt texts)
- Buttons (centered or full width)
- Lists (ordered and unordered)
- Separators
- Block quotes

Thanks to our email base templates, your emails are fully responsive and work
great on mobile and desktop devices.

## Create Newsletters with Markdown

Markdown is probably the most intuitive markup language in the world. take a
look at the example below and it’ll make sense immediately:

```
This is a Headline
==================

1. This is a numbered list
2. With two elements

[This is a link to the Keila website](https://www.keila.io)
```

Whether you already love using Markdown or if you’re looking to send simple
single-column emails, the Keila Markdown editor has you covered!

<div class="md:flex flex-row gap-5">
  <KeilaImage
    src="/src/assets/screenshots/markdown-editor.png"
    alt="Screenshot of the Keila Markdown editor"
  />
  <KeilaImage

</div>

<video

  class="w-full shadow-lg"
  width="1280"
  height="800"
  autoplay
  loop
>
  <source src="/updates/2022-02-22-markdown-as-you-type.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

Compose your emails using plain Markdown or by using our Markdown-based WYSIWYG
editor to create your newsletter campaigns with Markdown in no time.

## Send Plain Text Newsletters

Sometimes, the best solution is also the simplest. If you prefer good old
plain-text emails instead of emails with fancy styling, Keila is a great choice
to send your plain-text email newsletter.
