# Forms: Create and Embed Newsletter Signup Forms

Create _Forms_ to allow new contacts to sign up to your newsletter.

You can either use them as stand-alone landing pages or include Keila signup
forms in your existing websites.

In order to create a form, navigate to the _Forms_ page and click on _Create new
Form_.

## Form Settings

In the _Settings_ tab, you can configure your formâ€™s title, button label, as
well as an intro, fine print, and thank you text.

The fine print supports limited HTML tags, allowing you to include links to your
website or privacy notice.

The option _Require captcha_ is generally recommended. Otherwise your newsletter
list may end up being filled with countless bot addresses which can ultimately
lead to your newsletter being classified as SPAM.

If you want to embed the form in your own website, make sure to enable the
_Allow embedding as HTML_ option.

## Form Fields

In the _Fields_ tab, you can configure which fields should be presented to
prospective contacts and which fields are required.

You can also adjust field labels and placeholder texts.

Right now, the following fields are supported:

- `email address`
- `first name`
- `last name`

In addition, you can specify custom fields for your form. The following types
are supported:

- Text fields
- Dropdowns (i.e. field with multiple options where only one option can be selected)
- Tags (i. e. a field where multiple options can be selected at the same time)
- Single Checkboxes

## Form Style

In the _Style_ tab, you can configure the color scheme of the form.
