# Self-Hosting Keila: Requirements

This guide leads you through the installation for self-hosting Keila on your own
server.

## Requirements

Keila is available as a Docker image.  
You can install it from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/pentacent/keila/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated) as `pentacent/keila`.

All you need to run Keila, in addition to the container engine of your choice,
is a PostgreSQL database.
