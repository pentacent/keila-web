# Senders: Bring Your Own Email Service

_Senders_ are how Keila manages methods of sending out your emails.

On Keila Cloud, you can use the _Send with Keila_ option to send your emails
without having to worry about the technical side of it.

If you’re self-hosting a small newsletter, you can use your personal email
(via SMTP). For larger projects it’s recommended to either use dedicated email
infrastructure or rely on an externally managed email service.

You need to create a Sender before you can send a campaign with Keila.

On your project overview page, click on `Manage Senders` and then on _Create new Sender_.

Currently, the following sender types are supported:

- SMTP
- AWS SES
- Sendgrid
- Mailgun
- Postmark

Additionally, if you’re using our [managed newsletter solution at keila.io](https://www.keila.io/pricing),
you can select _Send with Keila_.
