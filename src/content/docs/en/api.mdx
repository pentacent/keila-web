# API: Integrate Email Newsletters Into Your Existing Apps

You can use the Keila API to integrate your email newsletters with your existing
apps, and programmatically manage your contacts and campaigns.

The API design is based on [JSON API](https://jsonapi.org/), making it easy to
understand and work with.

## API Keys

In order to start using the API, you first need to create an API Key.

To create a new API key, select "API Keys" from the menu on the left, then click
on "Create new API key". Choose a name for your API key and confirm by clicking on "Save".

Now, the private API key is displayed. The key will only be displayed once and
canâ€™t be retrieved again.

## Authentication

For authenticating your API calls, use [_Bearer_ authentication scheme](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) with your private API key.
