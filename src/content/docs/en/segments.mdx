# Segments: Build Smart Contact Segments

Build smart subsets of your contact list with Keila using contact metadata or
custom data.These subsets are called _Segments_.

You can either use the visual editor to combine conditions, or build more
complex segments with the query editor.

## Keila Query Language

The Keila Query Language is inspired by MongoDB’s Query Documents and is fully
valid JSON.

The following operators are supported:

### match

The simplest operator is the match operator. It matches either exact values or
exact elements in an array.

#### Examples

Match an exact value:

```json
{ "email": "joe@example.com" }
```

```json
{ "data.age": 30 }
```

Match an array that contains an exact value:

```json
{ "data.tags": "rocket-scientist" }
```

### $and

The `$and` operator allows the combination of multiple conditions with a logical `AND`.
This means that all conditions need to be true in order to have a match.

#### Example

Match contacts that have both the `rocket-scientist` and `book-enthusiast` tag.
Contacts that have only one of the two are not matched.

```json
{
  "$and": [
    { "data.tags": "rocket-scientist" },
    { "data.tags": "book-enthusiast" }
  ]
}
```

### $or

The `$or` operator allows the combination of multiple conditions with a logical `OR`.
This means that at least one condition needs to be true in order to have a match.

#### Example

Match contacts that have at least one of the `rocket-scientist` and `book-enthusiast` tags.
Contacts that have both tags are also matched.

```json
{
  "$or": [
    { "data.tags": "rocket-scientist" },
    { "data.tags": "book-enthusiast" }
  ]
}
```

### $not

The `$not` operator allows the negation of a conditoin.

**Example**

Match contacts that _don’t_ have the `rocket-scientist` tag.

```json
{
  "$not": { "data.tags": "rocket-scientist" }
}
```

### $like

The `$like` operator is similar to the match operator but allows the use of `%` as
a wildcard.

#### Examples

Match all contacts with an email address that ends in `@keila.io`:

```json
{ "email": { "$like": "%@keila.io" } }
```

Match all contacts with a first name that contains the letter `a`:

```json
{ "first_name": { "$like": "%a%" } }
```

### $lt, $lte, $gt, $gte

`$lt` (lesser than), `$lte` (lesser than or equal to), `$gt` (greater than), and
`$gte` (greater than or equal to) are relative comparison operators.

#### Example

Match all contacts that were added before January 1 2022:

```json
{ "inserted_at": { "$lt": "2022-01-01T00:00:00Z" } }
```
