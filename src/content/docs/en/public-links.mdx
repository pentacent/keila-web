# Public Newsletter Archive Links

Sometimes you want to be able to share a campaign you've sent with people who aren't subscribed to your newsletter. Or you might want to allow subscribers to open your email in a browser.

This can be achieved by enabling *public links* for your campaign.

## Enabling the Public Link
You can enable the public link by ticking the "enable public link" checkbox when you create a new campaign or in the campaign settings dialog.
After you've sent a campaign, you can find the link in the "Share" tab on the analytics page. You can also enable or disable the public link from the "Share" tab after you've sent the campaign.

## Including the Public Link in Your Newsletter
If you want to use your campaign's public link directly in your campaign (e. g. to let people open your message in their browser), you can use the following code which will be replaced by the public URL: `{{ campaign.public_link }}`
