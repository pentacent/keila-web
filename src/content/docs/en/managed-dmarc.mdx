# Setting up your domain for SPF, DKIM & DMARC

Setting up your domain to comply with SPF, DKIM and DMARC requirements that are being
implemented by more and more email providers, is easy with Keila!

<ManagedNote />

## 1. Create a _Send with Keila_ Sender

If you don’t yet have one, create a [Sender](/docs/senders) in your Keila project and select the _Send with Keila_ option.
Make sure you can receive emails at the _From address_
(e.g. `newsletter@example.com`) so you can receive the confirmation email.

## 2. Pick your Mail From Domain

Choose a subdomain that is not currently used for anything else. This
subdomain will become your _Mail From Domain_. Common choices include `mailings.example.com` or `send.example.com`.

**Note:** You can’t use the _Mail From Domain_ in your _From address_. This
means if you configure _send.example.com_ as your _Mail From Domain_, you should
still use an email address on your principal domain (e.g.
*newsletter@example.com*) as your _From address_ and not an email address on
your _Mail From Domain_ (i.e. **don’t use** *newsletter@send.example.com*).

## 3. Update your DNS

Add the following entries to your DNS settings:

**Connect your Mail From Domain with CNAME**:  
`CNAME` `*your-subdomain*.example.com` `public.keila.io`

**Add the Keila DKIM key**:  
`CNAME` `keila._domainkey.example.com` `dkim.public.keila.io`

**Enable DMARC for your main domain**:  
`TXT` `_dmarc.example.com` `v=DMARC1; p=none`

## 4. Submit the Domain Connection Form

Now you’re almost done! Just submit our domain configuration form and we’ll take
care of the rest and get in touch with you.
