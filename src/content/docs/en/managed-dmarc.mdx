# Setting up your domain for SPF, DKIM & DMARC

Setting up your domain to comply with SPF, DKIM, and DMARC requirements that are being
implemented by more and more email providers is easy with Keila!

<ManagedNote />

## 1. Create a _Send with Keila_ Sender

If you don't yet have one, create a [Sender](/docs/senders) in your Keila project and select the _Send with Keila_ option.
Make sure you can receive emails at the _From address_
(e.g., `newsletter@example.com`) so you can receive the confirmation email.

## 2. Update your DNS

The sender page will now show you the DNS entries you need to add to your DNS settings.

Add them to your DNS settings:
| Subdomain | Type | Value |
|-----------|------|-------|
| keila-mx1 | CNAME | mx1.public.keila.io |
| keila-mx2 | CNAME | mx2.public.keila.io |
| keila1._domainkey | CNAME | dkim1.public.keila.io |
| keila2._domainkey | CNAME | dkim2.public.keila.io |

You also need a valid DMARC entry. If you don't have one yet, you can add a simple entry like this:
| Subdomain | Type | Value |
|-----------|------|-------|
| _dmarc | TXT | v=DMARC1; p=none |

## 3. Wait for DNS propagation

It can take some time for DNS changes to propagate to all email providers. Keila usually picks up your changes within a few minutes. You can manually check your settings by clicking the *Check domain* button.
