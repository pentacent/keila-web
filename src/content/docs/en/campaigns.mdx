# Campaigns: Create, Schedule, and Send Your Newsletters

_Campaigns_ are the emails you send to your contacts.

In order to create a new campaign, navigate to the _Campaigns_ page from the
main menu and click on _Create new Campaign_.

You can then choose a subject for your campaign and a your preferred editor.
Currently, you can choose between the _Block Editor_, the _Markdown editor_, and
the _plain text editor_.

## Liquid Templating

Keila supports the [Liquid template language](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/)
in campaigns. The following Liquid assigns are available in every campaign:

- `{{ contact }}` - Object with data about the contact receiving the email with
  the following properties:
  - `{{ contact.email }}`
  - `{{ contact.first_name }}`
  - `{{ contact.last_name }}`
- `{{ unsubscribe_link }}` - URL of the one-click unsubscription link

If not all contacts in your database have given their first name, Liquid’s `default`
tag is very useful.

`Hey {{ contact.first_name | default: "there" }}` will render as `Hey Jane` for
a contact with the first name `Jane` and as `Hey there` for a contact with no
first name set.

## Markdown

Markdown campaigns support Liquid templating just like plain-text campaigns do.
In addition, text you enter is processed as [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

Since Markdown doesn’t natively support the creation of buttons, here’s a little
trick you can use with Keila:

`#### [Your text](https://example.com) ####` is automatically turned into a
call-to-action button.

## Scheduling Campaigns

You can schedule your newsletters to be sent at a later date. In order to do
that, click on _Schedule_ on the top right and select the desired date and time.
