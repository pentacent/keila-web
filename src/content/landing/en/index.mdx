      ## Here’s why you’ll love Keila

      ### Emails That Just Work
      Creating emails that work across devices and clients can be difficult.
      With Keila’s rock-solid base templates, your newsletters always look
      great – no matter if recipients are using Gmail, Outlook,
      Thunderbird, if they’re on mobile, or on a desktop computer.


      ### Create Emails Your Way
      - You don’t want to code and prefer to design your newsletter in an
        **easy-to-use visual editor**? Keila’s powerful Block Editor is the
        right choice for you.
      - You love the simplicity of Markdown? With Keila, you can
        **write newsletters with Markdown** directly or use our
        Markdown-powered WYSIWYG editor.
      - You want full flexibility and customize every aspect of your design?
        **Keila is the platform of choice for sending emails you build with MJML**.
      - Prefer plain text? **Send your HTML-free** no-frills emails
        with Keila.

      ### Powerful Analytics and Great Privacy Options
      Keila’s email analytics give you all the insights you need to make the
      most of your campaigns - while still respecting user privacy and not
      collecting more than is necessary and useful. If you prefer to be even
      more privacy-conscious, you can easily turn off tracking entirely.

      ### Create Forms with Custom Fields with Our Flexible Form Builder
      With Keila’s Form Builder, you can create and design sign-up forms for
      your newsletter. **Customize your forms with additional checkboxes,
      text fields, and dropdowns**.


      ### Protect Your Newsletter from Bots
      Any online form attracts bots. And when bots sign up to your newsletter,
      it negatively impacts the quality of your contact list and might
      ultimately jeopardize the deliverability of your emails.
      With Keila, you can easily **protect your forms with a captcha check and
      verify new sign-ups with double-opt-in**.


      ### Personalize Emails with Custom Data and Liquid Templates
      Keila makes it easy to personalize campaigns with the custom data fields
      from your sign-up forms or from external sources (e.g. CMS or CRM systems).
      Custom data for every contact and every campaign is represented as a
      single JSON object. You can use Shopify’s Liquid template language to
      personalize emails with custom data or build fully dynamic email templates.

      ### Target Emails with Segments
      To help you better target your contacts with emails that are relevant to
      them, you can create subsets of your mailing list based on contact data
      like language preferences or tags.

      Keila includes a visual segment editor and a powerful segment language for
      more complex cases.

      ### Extensibility With a Comprehensive API
      Keila offers a comprehensive API to manage contacts and campaigns. This
      allows you to create integrations with your existing tools and automate
      your email marketing workflows. For a no-code/low-code option, we
      currently have a Zapier integration in private beta.

      [Take a look at the Keila API docs.](https://app.keila.io/api)


      ### No Vendor Lock-in and 100% Open Source
      Keila is 100% Open Source with no proprietary premium features. You can
      become a part of the community by contributing bug reports,
      translations, or code on GitHub.
