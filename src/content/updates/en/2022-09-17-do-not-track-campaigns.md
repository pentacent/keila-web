**Keila now allows you to completely disable open/click tracking for campaigns.**

With this new feature, you can now ensure the privacy of your users even better
than before: Enabling the "do-not-track" setting for a campaign completely
disables all tracking features for this campaign: Neither opens nor clicks will
be tracked. Links youâ€™ve included in your email will not be rerouted through
Keila.
