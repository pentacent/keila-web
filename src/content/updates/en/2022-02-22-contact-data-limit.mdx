**Previously, the amount of custom JSON data that could be stored alongside every
contact was unlimited. It’s now possible to store up to 8 KB of custom data
for every contact.**

While 8 KB might not sound like a lot of data, it should be more than sufficient
for almost any purpose. 8 KB are equivalent to a 1,000 word text document or
a JSON document with 500 data points, depending on the structure of the data.

The newly introduced campaign data feature allows for twice as much data with 16
KB per campaign.
