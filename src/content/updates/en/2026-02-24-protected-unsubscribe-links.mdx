_Unsubscribe and double opt-in links are now protected against accidental activation by mail scanners._

Automated email scanners often automatically follow links in emails, which can lead to accidental unsubscribes or opt-in confirmations. To prevent this, we’ve added an additional verification step for unsubscribe and double opt-in links if they are clicked within three minutes of the message being sent.

For most users, this change will be seamless. The verification is handled automatically via JavaScript, so no manual action is required. If JavaScript is disabled in the browser, a confirmation button will be displayed to ensure the action is intentional.
