**The addition of _Custom Campaign Data_ enables users to automatically populate

Keila has long allowed users to specify custom data on a per-contact basis,
a concept known as _merge fields_ elsewhere. But now Keila takes data-driven
campaigns one step further: Itâ€™s now also possible to specify custom data at
the _campaign level_.

Specifying data at the campaign level allows the creation of fully automated
campaigns, where some or all of the campaign text is generated based on custom
data and a template.

## Example

In this example, we want to include a list of books with titles linked to
product pages in an email.

To achieve this, we specify the following campaign data with a list of available
books:

```json
{
  "books": [
    {
      "title": "The Earth Book",
      "link": "https://books/earth-book"
    },
    {
      "title": "The Mars Book",
      "link": "https://books/mars-book"
    }
  ]
}
```

In the campaign editor, we can now write the following Markdown template using
the Liquid template language:

```liquid

{% for book in campaign.data.books %}

- [{{ book.title }}]({{ book.link }})

{% endfor %}
```

This will create a list of books based on our campaign data.
