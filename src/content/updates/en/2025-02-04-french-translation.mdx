Thanks to a volunteer effort, the Keila interface is now fully available in French.
So now we’re happy to respond "Oui" to the question "Parlez-vous français"?

And if you want, you can help by adding your own language! There is a short [technical translation guide on GitHub](https://github.com/pentacent/keila/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#translating-keila).
If you would like to contribute and need help getting started, please don’t hesitate to ask for advice on GitHub
or simply send an email to <Email user="hello" domain="keila.io" />.
