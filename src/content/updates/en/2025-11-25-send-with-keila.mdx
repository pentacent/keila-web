## New Setup Assistant
Setting up senders in Keila Cloud has just become a lot easier! The new setup assistant guides you through sender configuration and automatically helps you verify your DNS settings to ensure your emails are delivered reliably. No more manual intervention from the Keila team is necessary. <I18NLink collection="docs" i18nId="managed-dmarc" lang="en">Read more about setting up your domain with DMARC and DKIM.</I18NLink>


## Shared domain support
You can now send newsletters with Keila Cloud even if you don't yet have your own domain.

When you're using a shared domain (such as `mailbox.org`, `proton.me`, or `gmail.com`), Keila now automatically sends your emails from our verified `keilamails.com` domain while preserving your original email as the Reply-To address. <I18NLink collection="docs" i18nId="shared-domains" lang="en">Read more about shared domains.</I18NLink>
