**Keila now allows you to use variables in subject lines for more personalized campaigns.**

The use of the Liquid templating language is now fully supported in campaign
subjects. This means, you can now fully personalize an email subject for a
recipient, just like you can already personalize email contents with Keila.

This example illustrates how you can use dynamic email subjects:

If you wanted to send an email announcing the dynamic email subject features,
you could now use the following subject line:

`{{ contact.first_name | default: "Hey" }}, Do You Want Dynamic Email Subjects?`

A contact named `Jane` would receive an email with the following subject:
`Jane, Do You Want Dynamic Email Subjects?`. A contact that hasnâ€™t provided
their name when signing up, would instead receive the subject
`Hey, Do You Want Dynamic Email Subjects?`.
