Uploading images is now possible directly from the WYSIWYG editor of Keila.

Previously, if you wanted to include an image in your newsletter, you had to
manually upload it to an external server and then use the image URL in Keila.

With the new image upload feature, you can easily upload images directly from
Keilaâ€™s WYSIWYG editor.

<KeilaImage

Keila servers can be configured to serve image uploads directly or have them
by a separate server on a separate domain - which is recommended for security
purposes.
