**You can now send test emails for your campaigns and preview them for desktop & mobile**

## New Preview Experience

Last year, we introduced a new preview experience alongside the MJML editor. The new
preview lets you toggle between mobile and desktop view, helping you understand how your
email is going to look on different devices.

## Sending Preview Emails

Finally, one of our most frequently requested features has found its way into Keila.
You can now send a preview email to up to five recipients directly from the campaign
editor. This sends out the email using the sender youâ€™ve selected for the campaign.

The new feature also helps you test your dynamic templates: If an email address
you're sending the preview to exists in your contact list, their contact information
and data fields are used in the email sent to them.
