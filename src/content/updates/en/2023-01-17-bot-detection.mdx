**Keila now excludes bots from Gmail/Google from your campaign open counts**

Some email providers automatically fetch images or links from your newsletter
campaigns. This can lead to skewed statistics when these bots are counted like
real "opens" or "clicks".

Keila now excludes bots from Gmail/Google from the campaign statistics, making
sure you get more accurate data in your analytics.
