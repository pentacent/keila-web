Welcome emails are a great way to greet new subscribers and set expectations for your newsletter. You can now configure a welcome email directly in the form editor.

## How It Works

When you edit a signup form, you'll find a new **Welcome Email** tab. Enable the option and configure your email subject, sender, and content. The welcome email is sent automatically when a contact completes their subscription:

- **Without Double Opt-In**: The email is sent immediately after the form is submitted.
- **With Double Opt-In**: The email is sent after the contact clicks the confirmation link.

## Writing Your Welcome Email

The email body supports both Markdown and Liquid. You can personalize your welcome emails using these variables:

- `{{ contact.email }}` – The subscriber's email address
- `{{ contact.first_name }}` – The subscriber's first name
- `{{ contact.last_name }}` – The subscriber's last name
- `{{ contact.data.* }}` – Any custom fields from your signup form

### Example: Welcome Email with a Download Link

A common use case for welcome emails is delivering a *lead magnet*, e.g. a free download or a discount code. Here's an example that includes a download button:

```markdown
# Welcome, {{ contact.first_name }}!

Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter. We're excited to have you on board.

Note that `####` followed by a link creates a button in your email – a handy Keila feature for calls to action.
