**Keila now gives you more insights into your campaign performance.**

In previous versions, Keila only included open/click rate and the number of
emails delivered on the campaign statistics page.

The new and fully revamped campaign analytics page now includes a 24-hour graph
with your campaignâ€™s open and click performance to give you a better
understanding of how your campaign did at a single glance.

Another important new metric that we added to the statistics page is the number
of contacts who have have unsubscribed from your list following the unsubscribe
link in your campaign.

In addition to this, if you using _Send with Keila_ on our managed service or an
Amazon SES sender with webhooks fully set up, you can now also see the number of
bounces, and spam complaints for your campaign.
