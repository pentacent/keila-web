*Synchronizing your CRM contacts with your email contact list just got a lot easier.*

We’ve recently added an `external_id` field for your contacts in Keila.
This makes syncing your newsletter list with external systems (like CRMs) a breeze.

Previously, updating contacts in Keila required matching email addresses.
If an email had changed in your external system, a new contact was created when running the next import.

Imagine you have a contact, Mario Rossi, with the email address *mario.rossi&#8239;@&#8239;example.com*. In your CRM, Mario has the ID `12345`
and you’ve included this information in the `external_id` field in Keila.
When Mario gets married and changes his last name, you update his entry in your CRM to include his new email address, *mario.bianco&#8239;@&#8239;example.com*.
If you provide his external ID when you do your next import, Keila will recognize Mario as the same contact and update his email address without creating a new entry.
No more duplicates, yay!

The `external_id` field is supported both for imports from spreadsheets and for API calls. You can also set it manually in the Keila user interface.
