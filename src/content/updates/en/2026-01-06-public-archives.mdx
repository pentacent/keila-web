_Your sent campaigns can now be shared publicly with archive links._

We've added the ability to create public archive links for your campaigns. This makes it easy to share your newsletter content beyond your subscriber list.

## How It Works

Once you've sent a campaign, you can now generate a public archive link. This link can be shared anywhere – on social media, your website, or in follow-up communications.

You can read more about public links in the <I18NLink collection="docs" i18nId="public-links" lang="en">documentation</I18NLink>.

## Reviewing Sent Campaigns

Along with public archives, we've also added the ability to review your sent campaigns directly in Keila. This makes it easy to check exactly what was delivered to your subscribers before sharing it publicly.
