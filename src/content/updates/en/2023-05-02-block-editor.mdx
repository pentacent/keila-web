**You can now build multi-column email campaigns with Keila. No coding required.**

Keila 0.12 introduces a new option for composing email campaigns. In addition to
plain text and Markdown (with or without WYSIWYG) campaigns, you can now use
the WYSIWYG Block Editor to create rich, multi-column, emails.

## Included Blocks

The new editor comes with all the blocks you need to build a great-looking email:

- Text paragraphs
- Headings
- Images (with support for links, captions, alt texts)
- Buttons (centered or full width)
- Lists (ordered and unordered)
- Separators
- Block quotes

A small improvement for the button component is that you can now choose whether
it should be centered or full width:
